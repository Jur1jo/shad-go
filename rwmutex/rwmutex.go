// A RWMutex is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock.
// The lock can be held by an arbitrary number of readers or a single writer.
// The zero value for a RWMutex is an unlocked mutex.
//
// If a goroutine holds a RWMutex for reading and another goroutine might
// call Lock, no goroutine should expect to be able to acquire a read lock
// until the initial read lock is released. In particular, this prohibits
// recursive read locking. This is to ensure that the lock eventually becomes
// available; a blocked Lock call excludes new readers from acquiring the
// lock.

	r chan int
	w chan struct{}
}

// New creates *RWMutex.
func New() *RWMutex {
	mu := RWMutex{r: make(chan int, 1), w: make(chan struct{}, 1)}
	mu.r <- 0
	return &mu
}

// RLock locks rw for reading.
//
// It should not be used for recursive read locking; a blocked Lock
// call excludes new readers from acquiring the lock. See the
// documentation on the RWMutex type.

// RUnlock undoes a single RLock call;

// on entry to RUnlock.

// Unlock unlocks rw for writing. It is a run-time error if rw is
// not locked for writing on entry to Unlock.

// goroutine. One goroutine may RLock (Lock) a RWMutex and then
// arrange for another goroutine to RUnlock (Unlock) it.
